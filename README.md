Wiki:

The Ulam spiral or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam in 1963 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific American a short time later. It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.
